This zip contains code examples from throughout the book, separated by chapter.

Most of the examples will break if you simply open them with a web browser. Instead, stage the files on your local web server. Here are instructions for different platforms:

1. Place the examples in your Sites directory.
2. Open up terminal and enter the following command:
sudo apachectl start
3. Navigate to http://localhost/~YourUserName/codeSamples.

== Localhost on Windows ==

Either use Wamp ( ) or follow the instructions here:
